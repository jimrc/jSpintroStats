# jSpintroStats

A web-based set of tools to support a way to learn and teach introductory statistics.

Several recent textbooks have shown that students can understand complex statistical ideas without first learning probability rules based on normal theory.  Instead, teachers can utilize common knowledge of random spinners and random selection (drawing balls from urns) to motivate ideas like "strength of evidence" (p-value) and confidence intervals.
 We break down the possible data analyses into:
 * One categorical variables
 * One quantitative variables
 * Two categorical variables
 * Two quantitative variables
 * One categorical and one quantitative variables
 Within each category, the user may enter data and make inference using resampling or randomization methods.  All confidence intervals are based on bootstrapping.

 Under "One Cat" and "Two Cat" menus users will find pages that calculate normal (gaussian) probabilities and endpoints.  Under "One Quant","Two Quant" and "One Cat, One Quant" menus are similar t-distribution apps.

 Also under the  "One Cat" menu are several demos: a  spinner (as for many game boards),  a mixer (randomly selecting balls from an urn), a "Meaning of Confidence Interval" demo and a demo of the efect of an unmeasured "lurking" variable.

 Also under the "One Quant" menu are demos of Bootstrapping, Lurking variable effects, a sampling demo, and a power demo.

 Under "Two Quant" a regression demo is planned.



 This software is intended to demonstrate the concepts underlying statistical analysis. It is not, in itself, a statistical analysis package. We hope users find it useful, but no explicit or implicit warrantee is made for accuracy of results.
